  &#127936; &#127939;I once entered a netball competition to represent the Information Management faculty and
   although our group did not win, it was a very meaningful experience. &#127939; &#127936;

  &#127850;In the last semester I had to do business to complete the ENT300 assignment. At first,
  I never thought of doing business but through this experience I was able to make a
  new experience
  to do business. Above is the logo for my business, Pretzelslicious and
  my IG shop account.&#127850;

  &#128507;Last year I did a lot of different activities with my friends and one of the experiences that 
  I can't forget last year was, we climbed a hill which is Taisho Hill together. The scenery there 
  is very beautiful although tired of climbing but when looking at the views above can
  lose the feeling of tiredness and very worthwhile. &#128507;
